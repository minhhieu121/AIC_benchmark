A young woman with long brown hair, wearing a green shirt and a brown bag strap, walks past a brick wall; later, she is shown in various indoor settings: first in what appears to be a domestic or social setting, holding a bottle, among others in various states of dress; later, kneeling on a rug.  Finally, she is shown seated in a laboratory while a man in a white coat attends to her.  In a final scene, she sits at a bar with a man, while others sit around them.
