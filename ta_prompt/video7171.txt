A series of scenes depict people speaking at a press conference, some holding notepads and microphones,  with a large audience and photographers present. One woman is blonde with pink streaks in her hair, wearing a white Mickey Mouse t-shirt and black pants; another woman has shoulder-length reddish-brown hair and is wearing a black blazer; and a man in a brown suit and striped tie is also speaking.  A man wearing glasses and a maroon sweater is also seen taking notes.  The setting appears to be indoors with large windows overlooking a city street. Another scene shows a man wearing a gold crown and red shirt giving a thumbs up.
