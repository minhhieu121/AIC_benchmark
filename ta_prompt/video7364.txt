The video shows a series of blurry shots of people walking in a crowded outdoor area, interspersed with text overlays that state "MEN can use urinals in public toilets for FREE" and "WOMEN don't have urinals and are forced to PAY."  A clearer shot shows a woman in a blue patterned top and purple scarf speaking in a narrow alleyway with makeshift dwellings visible in the background.
